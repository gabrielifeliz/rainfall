How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?
To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: 
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. 
(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by 
the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 
cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons 
(because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).
Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers 
provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.

PSEUDOCODE
Prompt user for lengthInFeet
Get lengthInFeet
Prompt user for widthInFeet
Get widthInFeet
Prompt user for rainfallInInches
Get rainfallInInches
Calculate lengthInInches = length * 12
Calculate widthInInches = width * 12
Calculate runoffInCubicInches = lengthInInches * widthInInches * rainfallInInches
Calculate runoffInGallon = waterVolume / 231
